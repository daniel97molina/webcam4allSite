        This privacy policy governs your use of the software application
        "Webcam4all IP Camera" for Android devices, created by 503 Studios
        ("developer"), available on the Google Play Store and at {" "}
        <a href="https://webcam4all.surge.sh">webcam4all.surge.sh</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        Your Consent: By using the Application, you are consenting to the
        collection and storage of your information as set forth in this Privacy
        Policy now and as amended by the developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Application does not collect any personal information. Camera video
        and microphone audio data is streamed directly to connected client
        programs, such as your web browser, and you are fully responsible for
        all information contained within the live audio and video stream. The
        access to the data streams are ruled by your Firewall settings, which
        are, in most cases, configured to block access from outside the local
        network by default. Enabling external access requires the user to
        manually configure the firewall and should be done at users own risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can erase all data stored by the Application by uninstalling it from
        the device using the standard uninstall processes as may be available as
        part of your Android system.

        advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising
        provided in the Application which helps keep the cost of the Application

        information within the Application context, including, but not limited
        to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device, anonymous
        information about other applications you've downloaded to your mobile
        device, your non-precise location information, and other non-precise
        location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous
        targeted advertising on the Application and elsewhere. Non-personally
        identifiable information is shared with AdMob and Google Play Services{" "}
